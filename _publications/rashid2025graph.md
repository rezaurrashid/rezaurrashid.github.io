This work, a major part of my PhD dissertation, introduces a novel GNN-based probabilistic framework that learns a distribution over the entire space of causal graphs, moving beyond methods that output a single deterministic structure. Our model integrates rich statistical and information-theoretic features from both nodes and edges, enabling the discovery of complex causal structures directly from data. It is trained to generalize from synthetic to real-world datasets, and we show that it outperforms both traditional and recent baselines in accuracy and scalability. The preprint can be accessed here: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20349).
