This work explores how influential users shape polarization dynamics on social media platforms (Twitter), especially in the context of sensitive topics like climate change and gun control. By leveraging the idea of a counterfactual framework, we assessed scenarios with and without specific influencer-led conversations, providing insights into how these interactions amplify or mitigate affective polarization. This research highlights the significant role influencers play in shaping public sentiment online.. The preprint can be accessed here: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15893).
